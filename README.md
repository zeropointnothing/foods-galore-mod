Foods Galore is a Fabric food mod for Minecraft that aims to enhance your culinary adventures by adding several new food items, such as chocolate or grilled cheese, each with their own recipe chains.

Not only that, but with the longer process, you'll be rewarded with far superior items to fill your stomach quicker than ever before!

## Disclaimers

This is my first mod. While I do consider myself proficient in the realm of programming, that means that I'm still learning how all of this works and cannot guarantee anything. Regardless, I will be trying my best to make this mod worthy of being in anyone's mod list.

Foods Galore! is in Alpha. This means *nothing* is final, so you should expect bugs, odd behavior, or item removal at any time.

## Forge/Version Support

- As of now, I don't plan on supporting Forge due to previous issues with their MDK and how well Fabric has worked for me.

- In the future, if I can get a solid grip on how all of this works, I plan on attempting ports to other versions.
