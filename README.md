A simple Fabric mod that adds new food items (and some drinks) into Minecraft.

## Disclaimer

This is my first mod. While I do consider myself proficient in the realm of programming, that means that I'm still learning how all of this works and cannot guarantee anything. Regardless, I will be trying my best to make this mod worthy of being in anyone's mod list.

## Forge/Version Support

- As of now, I don't plan on supporting Forge due to previous issues with their MDK and how well Fabric has worked for me.

- In the future, if FG gets enough attention I will consider porting to other versions.
