Foods Galore is a Fabric food mod for Minecraft that aims to add more to your culinary adventures with new foods and some drinks.

Who needs Steak or Bread when you could be eating delicious chocolate, or even better, toast!

## Disclaimer

This is my first mod. While I do consider myself proficient in the realm of programming, that means that I'm still learning how all of this works and cannot guarantee anything. Regardless, I will be trying my best to make this mod worthy of being in anyone's mod list.

## Forge/Version Support

- As of now, I don't plan on supporting Forge due to previous issues with their MDK and how well Fabric has worked for me.

- In the future, if I can get a solid grip on how all of this works, I plan on attempting ports to other versions.
